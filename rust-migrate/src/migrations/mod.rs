//! The system database schema: the migration SQL and the rendering that makes it executable.
//!
//! Every DBOS implementation must produce the same schema — a Rust application can share a
//! system database with one written in Python, TypeScript, Go, or Java — so the statements in
//! `migrations/` are not free to change. What has to match is the schema the database ends up
//! with, including column types; the filenames and comments are this crate's own.
//!
//! Porting a migration:
//!
//! - Add the file to `migrations/` and list it in [`SOURCES`]. The number comes from the
//!   filename.
//! - Use `INT4`, never `INTEGER`. CockroachDB reads `INTEGER` as 64-bit where PostgreSQL reads
//!   32-bit, so `INTEGER` produces a different schema per backend.
//! - Write `{{schema}}` and `{{concurrently}}` for the values filled in at runtime, and
//!   render with [`render`]. Single braces are literal, so `'{}'::JSON` and plpgsql's own
//!   `%s` format strings need no escaping.
//! - Give whole files to the driver. Splitting statements on `;` breaks the `$$`-quoted blocks
//!   in migrations 1, 14, 38, 39, 105, and 113.
//!
//! Applying the corpus to both backends is what verifies it; reading the SQL is not enough.
//!
//! Copied verbatim into `rust-migrate/` beside this file; `DEFAULT_SCHEMA`, which lived in
//! the crate's `sysdb` module, is inlined below so the copy stands alone.
